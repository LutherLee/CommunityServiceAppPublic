      "recipientDetail": "<b>How we started</b>\nThe Malaysian Care story is simple yet big in dreams. Sometime in the late 1970s, a group of young Christians were inspired to put their faith into action.  A Board was soon elected in 1978, comprising 11 visionaries like Wong Kim Kong, Lim Heng Seng, Lim Wei Meng, Shirley Lee, Jack Cheah, Liew Chee Kien, Steven Chong and Doreen Chan, with David Boler, Rev. Douglas Anderson and Timothy Phua as advisors.\n\nMalaysian Care became official in 1979 as a registered establishment and started its first home “Rumah Care” which provided shelter for children whose parents were patients at Sungai Buloh Leprosarium. On 1st January 1980, Rev Peter Young was appointed the first Executive Director of Malaysian Care.\n\nFrom then till now, our purpose remains to encourage active social work amongst the churches in Malaysia, being the visible expression of the wholistic mission of Christ although the expressions of our actions may be have taken different directions according to the needs of the current time.\n\n<b>Where we are today</b>\nMalaysian Care today is an organisation offering diversified services such as residential care and community services and is strongly committed to community development. Beginning with just a staff team of five, today we have over 60 staff. Apart from direct services by staff and partners, we seek to inform, educate and encourage Christians to be involved with the poor and deprived. Malaysian Care also offers consultancy, partnerships and networking with Churches and groups to set up social caring ministries across Malaysia.\n\n<b>Our core services</b>\n1) <i>Rural and Urban Community Development</i> – working alongside with the Orang Asli, indigenous people in Sabah, urban poor and refugee communities: agriculture development, economic development, community-based resource centre, youth development\n\n2) <i>Services for People with Special Needs</i> – early intervention programme; school-age programme; inclusive preschool programme; workbase and job coach; family resource and support services; training for teachers parents; awareness\n\n3) <i>Prison, Drugs and AIDS</i> – prison, substance abuse and addiction ministry; counselling and referral; aftercare; community-based support for people living with HIV/AIDS; youth and juvenile programmes\nHow you can help\n\nVolunteer at any one of the roles here, select one that fits you – click <a href=\"https://www.malaysiancare.org/volunteerism\">here</a>.\n\n<b>Donation</b>\nDonate to us: We are tax exempted and our banking details can be found <a href=\"https://www.malaysiancare.org/donate\">here</a>. Our finances are first audited by internal auditors and then by professional external auditors. Financial accounts are submitted annually to the Ministry of Finance and the Registrar of Societies.

However, it must be emphasised that not all centres cater to those with multiple disabilities. Hence the Society is focused on efforts to meet the needs of this category of disabled people.\n\n<b>Our needs</b>\nThe Society requires an estimated RM 20,000 monthly to maintain and run the training centre. Funds for this centre comes from donations received from the general public as well as annual government grants and subsidies from the Department of Social Welfare. Funds are also raised through various fundraising activities which are organised several times a year. The generous support of many caring Malaysians has indeed gone a long way to help us make life more meaningful for these children.\n\n<b>You can donate to us at:</b>\nName of Account :  Society for the Severely Mentally Handicapped\nAccount No           :  3078856036\nName of Bank      :   Public Bank",

The highest level of decision-making occurs at the WC or Working Collective level which comprises of both the Executive Council, EXCO members and member-staff.\n\nHowever, in 2018, we noted that member participation in committees have dropped significantly which eventually led to a shift in the organizational practices.

      "recipientDetail": "<b>What is MND?</b>\nMND stands for motor neurone disease and is a group of diseases which cause a loss of function (degeneration) of nerve cells which control muscles (so called motor neurons). These cells are located in the brain and the spinal cord. ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is particular form of motor neurone disease, often the abbreviations MND and ALS are used interchangeably.\n\nThe symptoms of motor neurone disease can vary a great deal between different individuals and involve weakness of particular muscle groups, such as the muscles of the legs, arms, throat and chest.\n\nAlthough there is no cure available today there is intense research being conducted globally to find a cure. Despite the absence of a cure much progress has been made in improving the quality of life of patients living with motor neurone disease through specialised teams. These teams include neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists and a number of other specialised support services.\n\nFor these reasons it is very important that care for MND patients is delivered by specialised teams. Our ambition is to extend this support to all Malaysians nationwide.\n\nBeing given a diagnosis of MND, or going through a diagnostic workup to rule out MND are very distressing experiences. It is very important that patients have access to the information they need. While a lot of information is available online it is important for patients to speak to their doctors personally to gain the proper understanding of their individual situation.\n\nIf you have any questions about MND please do get in touch with us!\n\n<b>Our Goals</b>\nAs a non-government organization we are supporting people living with MND through a variety of activities.\nWe are raising awareness among healthcare professionals and the general public through forums across the country. We believe it will require the understanding and effort of everyone to deliver care for patients with MND. We have conducted information events nationwide, most recently in Alor Setar, Ipoh and Penang\nWe are providing support to patients through our network of medical and non-medical volunteers and we are supporting healthcare professionals in the process of setting up MND services in their localities.\nWe also provide practical support to patients by loaning equipment such as portable ventilators, mobility aids and other items.\n\n<b>Donation</b>\nMND Malaysia welcome donations which can be bank into: \n\nMAYBANK\nAccount No: 514 123 636 197\nPayee: Persatuan Penyakit Motor Neuron",

Furthermore, PTM aims to contribute time and effort to upgrade facilities in the rural as well as the urban kindergartens through on-going seminars and art festivals to foster greater co-operation and understanding amongst operators and children of various kindergartens.\n\n<i>2) For Parents</i>\nParents play a very important role in the overall development of their children. Recognizing this, PTM engages child experts and provides services such as talks on child related issues that will further enhance their parenting skills. It is also PTM’s aim to disseminate literature and any other information regarding pre-school education to parents and the public.\n\n<i>3) For Kindergarten Operators</i>\nPTM also provides professional advice to kindergarten operators on a wide range of issues, from setting up to day-to-day operations. Through this support, we aim to ensure that all kindergarten facilities provide a conducive learning environment.\n\n<i>4) For Pre-School Teachers</i>\nPTM places great emphasis on training to improve the quality of pre-school teachers.

On a trip to Hualien, they witnessed the kindness demonstrated by Master Cheng Yen, and were touched by the spirit of Tzu Chi members in giving without hesitation and never expecting any reward in return. There and then, they decided to participate more actively in Tzu Chi work and donated four units of shoplots in Klang, turning them into the Klang Centre. On 31 August 2002, and with blessings from Master Cheng Yen, Tzu Chi Klang was officially opened by Tzu Chi’s Overseas Chief Executive Officer, Huang Si Xian.\n\nTzu Chi Klang operates within four units of shoplots, two of which are used as the Main Hall and the other two are presently occupied by the free clinic and Jing-Si Cafe. The spacious Main Hall was used for most activities, sharing and meetings. The cozy cafe is open to the public daily, demonstrating Tzu Chi culture by displaying and selling Tzu Chi Jing-Si books, Tzu Chi environmental friendly food containers, health beverages and so on. The Free clinic provides free medical services to the poor and needy families within the area.\n\nThe advancement of the Tzu Chi volunteers in Klang, and the expansion of its activities brought Tzu Chi Klang to the next level. In June 2003, and with the blessings from all, Tzu Klang changed its status to a Liaison Office, working hand in hand with the other Tzu Chi offices in the promotion of the Foundation’s four main missions.",

      "recipientDetail": "<b>Our Mission</b>\nRise Against Hunger is driven by the vision of a world without hunger. Our mission is to end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable and creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources.\n\n<b>Our Work</b>\nOur organization’s approach to ending hunger centers on mobilizing a global network of hunger champions. Rise Against Hunger meal packaging volunteers produce millions of nutritious meals annually that are then distributed to partners in countries around the world. Those partners are best able to address the causes and effects of hunger based on their local presence and expertise. Through our thorough monitoring and evaluation process, we ensure the meals distributed by those partners are used as a tool to change lives by promoting education, improving students’ health and nutrition, addressing gender inequalities, stimulating economic growth and fighting child labor.\n\nAnother core focus of Rise Against Hunger is responding to crises–both natural and man-made. From droughts to floods, in conflict zones and transitioning political situations, food is often the most immediate need. When everyday access to food, wages, and market systems are destroyed in the wake of emergencies, Rise Against Hunger works through a network of in-country partners to address these needs. We strive to ensure aid is efficiently and effectively deployed to and received by communities when it is needed most.\n\nOur third approach to eradicating hunger centers around grassroots community empowerment. Rise Against Hunger bolsters agricultural production and incomes through programs promoting improved agricultural methods, business skills, and market access. With training and access to quality seeds and fertilizers, farmers can increase production and harvest a variety of nutritious crops. By supporting the establishment of fish and livestock production, we also provide pathways to diversifying diets and improving nutritional outcomes.",

      "recipientDetail": "Need to Feed the Need (NFN) a non profit NGO under the purview of The Registrar of Societies bearing official name Persatuan Memberi Kepada Yang Memerlukan and registration number PPM-009-14-20042017.\nNFN is a soup kitchen that distributes food and other basic necessities in Kuala Lumpur. NFN operates out of Medan Kasih, a purpose built government-constructed facility at Lorong Medan Tuanku 2, every Thursday night.\n\nNFN’s patrons are the homeless and urban poor of all age groups; parents with newborn babies to senior citizens; anyone who has found themselves in difficult circumstances. Most of the able-bodied among them have jobs, though their meagre incomes may not be enough to pay for monthly room rental, let alone a two-month deposit. Some pay a daily rate of RM25 to RM40 for a squalid room with lumpy mattress just so their children could sleep. The majority of the families live in 4m x 3m makeshift rooms in converted shop-houses.\nEvery Thursday, NFN serves approximately 400 patrons with a hot meal, up to two side dishes (kuih, buns, etc.) and bottled water. The amount spent per person is about RM8, which equates to RM3,200 per week to sustain our basic operations. Partners and food sponsors Syed Bistro, MMZ Bistro, Meals For All and The Nasi Lemak Project also assist in providing meals for NFN’s patrons.\n\nNFN was founded in October 2013 by a group of individuals who identified a void in soup kitchen operations on Thursday nights. NFN was later registered as a legal entity under the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) in December 2014 and has since formally registered as an NGO under RoS as Persatuan Memberi Kepada Yang Memerlukan. With this, it is hoped that NFN can provide greater transparency and accountability to its donors. Although NFN is now a registered entity with a Board of Directors and Management Team, it is operated and managed entirely by permanent volunteers without reward, assuring our contributors 100% of aid received is channelled entirely back to those in need.\n\nProviding meals and other basic necessities such as toiletries and diapers is by no means a long term solution to the situation, but it does help the patrons get by in the meantime, in a small but meaningful way. As such, any contribution, no matter the amount, goes a long way towards helping NFN to help those less fortunate and deserving of a healthy meal.\n\nWe welcome sponsorship in various forms including supply of meal packs, bottled water, kuih or fruits for distribution or financial donations whereby we will procure the necessary through our long term catering partners who are vetted to meet our strict dietary requirements and portion sizes. Throughout the years, we have identified trends in numbers of patrons depending on the time of year and festive periods resulting in varying order sizes from as little as 250 packs to over 400 packs. We closely monitor these trends to ensure there is never any food wastage. Our management team would welcome the opportunity to discuss further in detail and work with you to develop a mutually sustainable sponsorship arrangement.",

      "recipientDetail": "Yayasan Chow Kit is a 24-hour crisis and drop-in centre providing meals, activities, therapy, case management, ​and educational programmes for at-risk children of Chow Kit.\n\nIn 2006, what started out as an expansion of a government-run day care centre, grew into a 24-hour crisis and drop-in centre, providing meals, activities, therapy, case management, and educational programmes for at-risk children of Chow Kit. Four years later, there are now additional two centres providing quality care and services to children ranging from babies to young adults.\n\nOur experience of working at the grassroots level has led to the discovery of an array of multi-faceted socio-cultural issues affecting such diverse groups of people living in Chow Kit. Realising that in order to provide a better facilitation of issues the community is facing, it paved the way for an establishment of an organisation that is based within the area in addition to having a structured and sustainable development of community-based programmes.\n\nThus that was how Rumah NurSalam, in its previous incarnation as a project under Yayasan Salam, has now become an entity in its own right, in the form of Yayasan Chow Kit, established in January 2011. The foundation’s vision ‘to improve the lives of at-risk children and youth’ has aptly summed up our aspirations for the community we serve in Chow Kit.\n\n<b>Our services</b>\nYCK’s daycare centre, ‘Taska Baitul Amal’ welcomes families to use the services provided for new- born babies until the age of four. The children will attend Pusat Jagaan Chow Kit from 5-7 years old. Once the children turn seven years old they will be welcomed into ‘Pusat Aktiviti Kanak-Kanak’ and upon reaching thirteen they move on to YCK’s youth activity centre – ‘KL Krash Pad’.\n\nAll the three centres provide food and age-appropriate facilities for our children. Yayasan Chow Kit opened the three centres based on a simple premise, to provide a safe and positive space in an area that may otherwise be unsafe, and allow for the children to grow up proud and not worry about the stigma attached to one of Kuala Lumpur’s vibrant and cosmopolitan inner city areas.\n\n<b>Mission</b>\nWe protect the rights of all at-risk children and youth, provide them with safe havens, and expose them to as many positive and holistic opportunities as possible to enable them to reach their full potential.",

Moved by the plight of countless innocent civilians, especially women and children, Dr. Jemilah Mahmood, a Malaysian obstetrician & gynaecologist, was moved to volunteer her medical services.\n\nFinding no national organisation ready to support such international crises, she established the Malaysian Medical Relief Society – better known today as MERCY Malaysia – with a handful of like-minded friends. MERCY Malaysia aimed to provide a platform for Malaysians to unite and play their role in the international humanitarian arena.\n\nMERCY Malaysia’s first mission was to Kosova in June 1999. Many more missions followed, each team consisting of Malaysians from all walks of life with the single goal of helping others, regardless of race, religion, culture or boundary.\n\nIn the last two decades, the organisation has provided humanitarian assistance and programmes in 32 countries, in crisis and non-crisis situations. MERCY Malaysia has also evolved into a full-fledged humanitarian organisation offering the full spectrum of humanitarian services, from emergency response to rehabilitation and recovery, mitigation and prevention, and disaster preparedness.\n\n<b>Vision</b>\nTo be outstanding in delivery of medical and humanitarian aid to all.\n\n<b>Mission</b>\nMERCY Malaysia is an international non-profit organisation focused on providing medical relief, sustainable health-related development, and risk reduction activities for vulnerable communities, in both crisis and non-crisis situations.",

The books will then be used to restock rural areas school or public libraries in Sarawak. Projek Pelita strongly believes that education would be the means to break the poverty cycle and to uplift the quality of life and standard of living of Malaysians in rural areas.\n\n<b>Our aims</b>\nAs the Malay saying goes, ‘Ilmu Pelita Hidup’- education is vital for society development; be it inside or outside the classroom. However, sad but true, there seems to be a major shortage of books and educational resources for children and students in Malaysia. The major concern is that students who experience this shortage of reading materials are mostly living in rural areas, who are most likely cannot afford to buy books and other educational needs for themselves if not provided for.\n\nTo address this issue and as part of our efforts to create awareness and promote voluntarism within Malaysian youth, last year, the UKEC came up with ‘Projek Pelita’ with the aim to host the biggest book drive in Malaysia’s history.\n\n<b>Our services</b>\n1. To expose the public to the rural area side of Malaysia, providing the whole nation the opportunity to help the disadvantaged students from poor backgrounds.\n\n2. To provide assistance in the form of book donations or purchase of teaching and education aids (e.g. reading materials, computers, etc.) to be distributed to the poor and underprivileged primary and secondary school students.\n\n3. To build or refurbish educational facilities in rural areas of Malaysia, such as school libraries, community libraries, resource centres with the aim to provide a comfortable and conducive place to study.\n\n4. Raising education awareness by carrying out motivational programmes to rural areas students with school academic performance will be closely monitored by Projek Pelita committee.",

The Home relies solely on public funding to maintain itself.\n\nAfter four years, the Home moved from an old rented bungalow in Old Klang Road to the new home Rumah Hope 1 in Paramount Garden , PJ. The construction of the home was possible thanks to generous contributions in cash and kind namely from Evangelical Lutheran Church Malaysia , Khalid Aluminium Industries Sdn Bhd, NGO’s the general public and various corporate bodies. Rumah Hope 2, a second block was opened on 10th October 2006.  Rumah Hope and Rumah Hope 2 will be able to house a maximum of 70 children.

All the management members are active in public life and are ardent supporters of various public welfare organizations.\n\nAlong with our efforts to secure funds, a request for an annual government grant is being made annually. With government aid backing us, the possibility of extending our reach to more children becomes very real.\n\n<b>Our needs</b>\nThe Home is grateful to its present batch of volunteer for sacrificing their personal interests for the children.

Datin Dr K Mangalaveni (Medical Practitioner) and Y.Bhg.Prof.Dr Zasmani Shafiee (Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist).\n\nThe purpose of setting up IMPIAN was the realisation to assist and provide opportunities for developing these special children’s potential in the real world. Among the programmes designed in IMPIAN are Early Intervention, Junior, Senior and Adult Programmes with Functional Academics and Vocational Programmes, Sheltered Workshop and Job Training. Other supplementary and support programmes include Occupational, Speech Therapy, Art, Music and Performing Arts and other Specialised Programmes.\n\n<b>Our needs</b>\nIMPIAN has obtained a JKM (Welfare Department) license (W/PJH OKU 001/2011) to operate Pusat Jagaan IMPIAN a training centre for Special Children. The operational costs of IMPIAN has increased by each year. The estimated monthly expenses (max 60student) are almost RM70,000 monthly.\n\nFees paid by parents of 60 special children at IMPIAN are estimated at RM40,000.00 per month which is not sufficient to cover the overall expenses as students fees vary according to their socio-economic status. To have a continuous and holistic program operational we do hope for support from private sectors and public in our fund raising and charitable activities.\n\n<b>Our services</b>\nWe have 40 students between the ages 4 and 23, who suffer from various learning disabilities such as autism, Down Syndrome, Attention Deficient Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). Services and Activities: Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, Sensory Integration Room and a Music Corner.\n\nWe are a non-profitable centre, solely depending on student fees and support from private sectors and public in donations, sponsorships and volunteers, to conduct continuous and holistic programs for the students at IMPIAN whose age range from 3years to adults."

No. 1659-03-5). Formed in 2003 by a group of parents, academicians and individuals with interests in special needs children development.CADS Enhancement Centre also provides the necessary counselling and support group for the family and care-givers of CADS children.\n\n<b>Our goals</b>\nOur goals is to provide CADS’s children with equal opportunity to develop and maximise their potentials, so that they will eventually grow into independent, productive members of the society and are respected by the community.\n\nLearning Disability is a tragic condition. Briefly, these children struggle to receive, retain and communicate information, learning today and forgetting it tomorrow. They find it very difficult to concentrate and reading is such a laborious effort. These setbacks are beyond their control. Often they have been labelled as stupid, dumb, lazy or retarded when in actual fact, these conditions usually hide a bright child whose intellect is waiting to be released given the right kind of alternate academic environment and therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe foundation upon which the CADS Enhancement Centre was developed is the belief that early intervention for children who are neurologically and developmentally disabled can enable them to achieve their full potential and enable them to attain a level of independence that will allow them to contribute appropriately to the society.\n\n<b>Our needs</b>\nThe programme at CADS Enhancement Centre is open to LD Children of all faiths and religions, across all economic strata of family backgrounds. We have made great strides since our inception despite the financial burden. Each year we constantly strive to seek grants and raise donations for the CADS Centre Fund to assure the solvency and longevity of the CADS Enhancement Centre.",

The centre taught English, Mathematics and Somali to a few individuals within the refugee community with the ability to pay RM80 per month.Under the leadership of the co-founders the centre was soon transformed into an initiative that reached out to over 100 underprivileged students, providing additional subjects from Computing to Art, Theatre and Green Living, as well as extra-curricular activities at no cost.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recognizes the Fugee School.",

Yayasan ini ditubuhkan pada pertengahan tahun 1999 dan sesi pengambilan pertama anak-anak ialah pada September 1999 iaitu seramai 30 orang. Sehingga kini setelah lima tahun beroperasi, asrama yang diberi nama Rumah Ilham ini boleh dimuatkan sehingga 80 orang anak-anak hanya menempatkan 60 orang anak-anak sahaja. Jumlah tersebut dikekalkan mengikut kemampuan kewangan yang sedia ada.

Yayasan ini berharap agar anak-anak ini cemerlang dalam bidang pendidikan sehingga ke peringkat tertinggi dan pada masa yang sama akhlak dan tingkah laku juga adalah terpuji. Dengan ini mereka boleh menjadi harapan bukan sahaja keluarga bahkan pada agama, bangsa dan negara.\n\n<b>Objektif kami</b>\n1) Memberi perlindungan, bimbingan, pendidikan kepada anak-anak yatim.\n2) Melahirkan generasi anak-anak yatim yang seimbang antara tuntutan rohani dan jasmani.\n3) Menjadikan generasi orang Muslim yang bukan sahaja berilmu dan beramal malah mengimplementasikan kepada masyarakat umum.\n4) Menjadikan mereka contoh serta harapan pada keluarga seterusnya agama, bangsa dan negara.\n\n<b>Visi kami</b>\nMelahirkan anak-anak yatim yang cemerlang, gemilang dan terbilang dari segala sudut sama ada rohani dan jasmani.",

We save and recycle “commercially-unwanted” foodstuff by gathering it from commercial outlets around town. We will then cook and serve free meals on the streets of KL every weekend.\n\nWe do this as a form of protest and also in order to raise awareness to the problems of wastage and unfair food distribution in our society. We also aim to empower the urban homeless & destitute community with solidarity, knowledge and basic living skills.\n\nHelp is always needed from you. We are in constant need of your solidarity, donations and manpower to keep this activity consistent and effective. We are thankful for anything which you can help us with, and appreciate your efforts in providing our fellow human beings struggling on the streets with their basic needs which the society at large took for granted.\n\nWe all look forward to working with you to tilt the scale back to equality.\n\nOperating hours: Every alternate Sunday, from 12:00 PM – 7:00 PM. Gathering of vegetables and food donation is a continuous basis, usually before Sunday. Cooking starts at 12:00 PM for a couple of hours in which preparing, cleaning and cooking takes place. By about 5:00 PM, we delivers our food to the serving location, just in time for the serving on Jalan Hang Lekiu venue between 6:00 PM until finish (which would usually be around 7:30 PM. Rain or shine FNB will be there.\n\nPlease take note that as much as we appreciate your monetary contribution, dry goods and other cooking stuff, fresh fruits and vegetables, clothing and other things that don't have to go to waste are most preferred. Check out our calendar if you are interested to join FNB activities or start your own chapter",

Ianya merupakan pusat penjagaan sepenuh masa yang dioperasikan sebagai salah satu usaha kebajikan bersama.\n\nKumpulan sasarnya adalah remaja puteri Islam yang berhadapan dengan masalah sosial dan memerlukan bimbingan dan perlindungan. Raudhatus Sakinah menyedari hakikat bahawa perangkaan kes-kes salahlaku di kalangan remaja Malaysia semakin meningkat apatah lagi di kalangan remaja melayu Islam. Bersamanya ia membawa pelbagai penyakit sosial yang akhirnya merosakkan bukan sahaja golongan remaja tetapi juga institusi keluarga dan seterusnya masyarakat.\n\nMalaysia kini jauh lebih maju daripada sedekad yang lalu. Kemajuan ini membawa bersama perubahan gaya hidup rakyat di setiap lapisan masyarakat. Kecenderungan untuk mencapai kehidupan yang lebih selesa dan bergaya membawa bersama beberapa implikasi negatif ke dalam kehidupan. Golongan yang tidak bertanggungjawab, demi kepentingan diri sendiri, tidak segan silu mengambil kesempatan daripada golongan yang lemah. Ledakan teknologi yang di antara lain membawa bersamanya perkembangan media cetak, eletronik dan internet menjadi gelanggang dan pemangkin kepada pelbagai budaya dan nilai sumbang. Wanita dan kanak-kanak sebagai sebahagian daripada anggota masyarakat tidak terkecuali daripada terkesan dengan perubahan yang berlaku terutamanya golongan remaja puteri. Kurangnya ketrampilan keibubapaan serta ilmu, menatijahkan generasi yang kurang terdidik dengan ilmu dan amalan agama yang sempurna.\n\n<b>Misi</b>\n1.

      "recipientDetail": "The Malaysian Healthy Ageing Society (MHAS) is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to imparting knowledge and education to healthcare professionals and members of the public on numerous healthy ageing issues. MHAS has taken on the task of organising the 1st World Congress on Healthy Ageing on 19 – 22 March, 2012 with the Theme: “Evolution: Holistic Ageing in an Age of Change”. The Congress is to be held at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nHealthy ageing is one of the major challenges for the world. The consequences of the demographic transition will have a tremendous impact on economy, health, social development and welfare of societies. Consequently, there is a need to enhance our knowledge about the promotion of good health among young and older people for a better quality of life in its later stages.\n\nHealthy ageing fostered by systematically planned health promotion efforts, was mentioned as early as 1998 as Target 5 in the WHO policy “Health for All in the 21st Century”. Active ageing (according to the European Commission) includes life-long learning, working longer, retiring later and more gradually, being active after retirement and engaging in capacity-enhancing and health-sustaining activities.\n\nThis first for Malaysia, if not the world, will encompass all aspects of health issues – prevention and management, the latest medical research and healthy ageing protocols – in both mainstream and complementary and alternative (CAM) medicines.\n\n<b>Mission</b>\nThe Malaysian Healthy Ageing Society‘s primary objective is to create public awareness for enhancement of the quality of life. MHAS organises programmes to inform physicians, scientists and members of the public on advancement in medical sciences and biomedical technology to detect, prevent and treat age-related disease."

We started as a “Graduate Fellowship” but change the name to “Gem” to look into growing needs of our community.\n\n<b>History</b>\nEvery year thousands of young Buddhists graduate from universities and colleges, but their talents go untapped. This was a big loss to the Buddhist community. Without new ideas and involvement from graduates, Buddhist societies could only run routine activities that attract a small crowd.\n\nBGF was formed to redress this problem back then. Its purpose was to gather young graduates as well as working professionals for spiritual friendship and enhance their knowledge and skills for Dhamma work. Since then, BGF has grown from strength to strength and embraces all various groups. Our roots are in the Pali Tradition and we are non-sectarian in our approach.\n\nWe started in a single storey house in Damansara Utama, Petaling Jaya and moved 4 times till our current location in Section 17 (bordering SS2, Petaling Jaya). We have been in our current premise for 11 years.\n\n<b>Our mission and programmes</b>\nBGF plays a pivotal role to bring about the “Transformation of the Malaysian Buddhist community”. Our motto is “Growing People, Inspiring the Future”. For over a quarter century, BGF has been nurturing Buddhist leaders. It organises many programs with impact on Buddhist communities within the country as well as internationally. BGF also organises camps for undergraduates, trains leaders to speak effectively in public, runs courses on counselling skills, and conducts training courses for Dhamma speakers. It runs weekly meditation sessions and organizes talks and public forums by local and international Dhamma speakers. Its innovative programs and approaches are adopted by other groups within as well as outside the country. Many of its early members had pioneered the formation of other Buddhist societies in the country.\n\n<b>Our vision</b>\nWe plan to transform the Malaysian Buddhist community through our “Eight Areas of Focus”. They are:\n1) Buddhist Education\n2) Counselling Services\n3) Creative and Performing Arts\n4) Dhamma Propagation\n5) Research and Publication\n6) Spiritual Development\n7) Training and Leadership\n8) Youth Development",

Kini kami disertai oleh 4 orang sahabat lain menjadikan 7 orang kini di dalam pasukan Projek Iqra’.\n\nIdea Projek Iqra’ ini tercetus setelah mendengar dan melihat sendiri kesukaran anak-anak yatim lepasan SPM menyambung semula pelajaran walaupun berminat dan mempunyai kelayakan kerana tidak mempunyai wang untuk membayar yuran pendahuluan di pusat pengajian tinggi, membeli perkakasan seperti buku dan peralatan untuk memulakan pengajian dan pelbagai kekangan lain yang menjadi tembok penghalang bagi mereka meneruskan cita-cita.\n\nSelain itu Projek Iqra’ juga bekerjasama dengan rumah-rumah anak yatim dalam menjalankan program berbentuk pendidikan, kesihatan dan lain-lain lagi yang boleh memberikan manfaat.\n\nProjek Iqra’ was founded by 3 friends who studied at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in 1998 until 2001 by Maman Solleh, Suhaimi Abdul Manan and Sharifah Sharina Syed Aswad who are actively involved in various charity and volunteering projects since 2010. Now, we are joined by another 4 friends which makes us 7 currently in the Projek Iqra’ team.\n\nThe idea of Projek Iqra’ triggered after hearing and seeing the hardships of the orphan SPM leavers to continue studying even though they are interested and qualified because they do not have the money to pay the advance fee of higher institution, purchasing stationeries such as books and equipment to start enrolling and other constraints that are a barrier wall for them to pursue their ambitions.\n\nOther than that, Projek Iqra’ is also collaborating with orphanage homes to conduct programs that are in the form of education, health and others that can provide benefits.\n\n<b>Donation</b>\nMaybank Acc: 5648-1050-4003",

To transform the mindset of the poor towards self-reliance and development of their own communities.\n\nFOCUSED is in contact with over 30 villages under its Orang Asli community development programmes. They have adopted 1 low-cost flats community as their urban community building project. Its programmes include Teens’ Service Centre (serving the young people from 12-18 years old), Teens’ Voice Centre (serving the young people above 18), Single Parents Support Group (in the early stages of identifying and providing services). FOCUSED plans to develop parental and self-help support groups in the community.\n\nIt is recognised that the low-cost community is ill equipped to face the rapid progress of urbanisation. The youths are particularly vulnerable to a wide array of social problems such as drug addition, lack of respect for parents and teachers, truancy, gangsterism and poor academic performance. Parents usually are too-stressed to cope with the market-oriented forces of urbanisation which inevitably result in broken family units. The incidence of social disorders such as crime, drug addictions and school dropouts are unusually high.\n\nIn its effort to meet the need of the squatter communities in Selayang, FOCUSED are working with schools, providing motivation programmes to the students, networking with the parents of the students and helping to facilitate parent support groups. FOCUSED hopes that with a support system that connects teacher, student, parent, community and the civil society, the squatter community will be better equipped to face the challenges of urbanisation.\n\nFOCUSED also has grass-root community programmes amongst the poorest of the poor, that is the Orang Asli community. Its programmes consist of educational classes, establishing income generating enterprises, micro-financing and building of basic infrastructure.\n\nThe vision of FOCUSED is to empower the poor to develop their own marginalised community by using a holistic development of mobilising, training and partnerships. To this end, it works with governmental agencies, NGOs, corporate bodies and members of the public.\n\nApproach:\n1. Working alongside the poor, and being a partner to their development.\n2. Spending the time nurturing their skills and potentials.\n3. Motivating them to participate in their own community building.\n4. Providing training tailored to the needs of the community.\n\n<b>Our Needs</b>\nVolunteer services required for projects.

The latter is closely associated with improvements in the socio-economic standards of the population and increased public demand for a better service for the community.\n\nAmong the several factors that prompted the growth of cardiology and became the stimulus for the start of NHAM are the growth and development of private medicine, the increasing influence of American Cardiology and the discovery and practice of selective coronary angiography, CABG surgery, and later coronary angioplasty.\n\nDr Nik Zainal who arrived as a trained cardiologist in 1977 organized the first fully equipped cardiac catheterization laboratory at General Hospital, Kuala Lumpur. CABG surgery then commenced in 1982. The challenges he faced were explained in his Sukaman Lecture in 1994.\n\nThe need for a heart association became pressing after the inauguration of Asean Federation of Cardiology in Bali, Indonesia in 1975. Malaysia represented by Dr R P Pillay, Dr NK Yong and Dr Joseph Eravelly were committed to hold a Congress of Cardiology by 1981. It was the only country in the Asean region that did not have a national cardiac society at that time.\n\nIt was only in 1978 that sufficient interest was generated for an inaugural meeting of the NHAM. The first President was R P Pillay, the Vice President was Dr N Krishnan, a thoracic surgeon working at Lady Templer Hospital and the first Secretary was Dr Joseph Eravelly. A Constitution was drafted and the Society obtained registration in 1979. The founding members of the National Heart Association were:"

Although registered under the Trustees Ordinance (Sabah) only in 1997, we have been actively involved with communities since 1987 as a different legal entity. PACOS is an acronym for ‘Partners of Community Organizations in Sabah’.\n\nThe organization sees itself as an organization that strives to empower indigenous communities through systematic building and strengthening of community organizations, which can act collectively on its own. We also realized the need to support networking among organizations struggling to assert right over community resources and revitalizing indigenous systems which is what we are currently striving to do.\n\nPACOS Trust supports community organizations in 14 districts (an increase of 4 from 2000/1) involving 23 geographical areas (including 7 new areas from last year), with each organization determining and implementing its own area plan and work programme. We have approximately 60 personnels from various expertise and background – almost all are working in their own communities but also contribute to the organization by being part of different ad-hoc committees as resource persons depending on their skills and knowledge. A Committee of the Board of Trustees oversees the direction of PACOS Trust.\n\nWe hope to have contacts in all 21 rural districts in Sabah with at least one community organization in each district. We also plan to boost our work on Land Rights by planning a 4-year land campaign, continue our effort to ensure active participants in regulating and protecting access to biological diversity and indigenous knowledge, participate and contribute actively in the Malaysia and Asia network, and provide input into development-related issues faced by indigenous communities.\n\nMuch of the financial resources of PACOS Trust are accrued from outside the country but the organization also raises funds through various activities (such as the research on forest-related knowledge with JOFCA-Japan, hosting international conferences) and contribution in kind by communities and its personnel. Among current major funding partners are the The Asia Foundation, Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact (AIPP), International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA), and Yayasan Daya Diri.",

      "recipientDetail": "<b>History</b>\nIn 1995, Sister Echo Chien led by example and encouraged the brothers and sisters from KL Branch to be more involved in Tzu Chi work. In June 1995, the KL Committee Members started visiting the home for mentally retarded children in Kuala Kubu Baru on a fortnightly basis. This was followed by the monthly visit to Sg Buluh home for the lepers. The said activities have continued till this day, and the ever increasing number of long term poor family cases has become KL Tzu Chi’s foundation.\n\nIn June 1996, Brother David Liu generously donated his 3,700 sq ft apartment to Tzu Chi, turning it into a place where the KL members would meet and conduct their activities. On 20 October 1996, and with the blessings from Master Cheng Yen, the new KL Centre was officially launched and opened by Master Bo-Yuan, Master Guo-Neng and Master Chang-Chao, marking yet another important milestone in the history of Tzu Chi KL.\n\nKL Tzu Chi expanded very quickly within a short span of time. With the effort of the Committee Members and a new Centre, many activities were held concurrently with the Melaka Branch. As these two branches share a lot in common, the Melaka sector was made a Branch on 21 May 1997, while KL was upgraded to a sub-branch.\n\n<b>Our centre</b>\nWith its expansion over the years, the old KL Centre needed more space to cater to its ever increasing activities. On 1 March 2004, the KL Branch moved to its present premises at Kelana Jaya, bringing it to yet another level and to train more volunteers. On 1 February 2006, KL sub-branch was upgraded to branch, making it the Centre for coordinating activities in central Malaysia, which covers Klang, Kuantan, Raub and others.",

Few years ago, I visited London for holiday together with my family. I was photographing the Tower Bridge and looked down to see the Thames River. I realize that the river there didn’t look any better than those next to my house in Malaysia.\nMy wife, Grace, suggested that we take up the challenge of promoting the Klang River as a premier tourist destination in Malaysia. River is a major tourist spot in many cities in Europe and America. \n\nIt truly is a waste for Klang City not to make use of the asset that we already have. Besides, we have a historic city bridge, JAMBATAN KOTA, that has been standing proudly for more that 60 years. Klang is an untapped historic city. My vision is to be able to someday tell my grandchildren that their grandparents have played a part in reviving the Klang River. Come join us in this movement.",

      "recipientDetail": "“A little Heaven for special children”\n\nThere are 250,000 people with special needs in Malaysia, one percent of its population of around 25 million. The country’s large proportion of young people means many of those with special needs are children. Dedicated therapies and care can help these physically, visually or mentally disabled children to meet their full potential. Tasputra Perkim, founded in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur in 1987, is a shining example of what is possible.\n\nThe centre is run from a government-owned house in a quiet but central part of the city. The 50 or so children who attend are mainly from lower-income Malaysian families living in the immediate area.\n\nSuch things don’t come cheaply – the centre always needs more money and equipment to meet its primary objective — which is to uplift the lives of the children in its care. Expert and non-expert volunteers and helpers are also of huge support to its ambitions.\n\nOur services\n\nThe children’s families pay up to RM200 per month (US$66) towards the costs, depending on what they can manage.\n\nAt the same time, Tasputra Perkim staff and associates understand there is much more to be done to help special needs children throughout Peninsular and East Malaysia. In addition to securing the centre’s own future, they want to share their experiences and lessons with others involved in special needs issues and those wishing to launch similar ventures throughout the country.\nOperation hours: The centre runs from 7.30 am to 5.00 pm every weekday and the office is open until 1.00 pm on Saturdays.\n\nStaff:\n\nGuided and headed by the chairman and co-founder, Mrs. Elahe Norman, there are 28 staff, 18 of whom are caregivers. The latter are trained to provide the children with special care in their feeding habits, exercise, personal training, behaviour management, hygiene and basic education. Others include a supervisor, physiotherapist, office administrator, cooks, drivers, a night-watch man and a gardener. We also get a number of local and foreign volunteers.\n\nIn-house training:\n\nThe staffs are constantly sent for training sessions. The Welfare Department gives courses in caring for special children, to which Tasputra sends its staff each week on a rotational basis. Various staff have also attended residential courses run in Ipoh by the Yayasan Idris Shah.\n\nFund Raising:\n\nTasputra runs almost entirely on donations and fundraising, receiving a government grant of only 19,000 ringgit ($5,000) a year. Our monthly expenses are 32,000 ($8,400) including staff salaries, maintenance of the house and vans, utility bills and food for the children.\n\nWe hold regular fund raisers such as jumble sales and bazaars hosted by hotels and societies. Tasputra invites people and associations from all walks of life to help in this charitable cause.\n\nWe have regular projects for fund-raising such as jumble sales and bazaars hosted by the hotels and societies. Tasputra constantly invites people and associations from all walks of life to help in this charitable cause. Some of past and present contributors are foreign missionaries and embassies in Malaysia and Women’s Associations.",

WWP promotes water demand management (WDM) to ensure that water resources are not depleted but remain sustainable. Via WDM, the amount of water saved nationally is significant and WDM can lead to saving mega-water projects for future generations. \n\nThrough domestic water audit (DWA), a form of WDM, water recycling and saving techniques become key strategies in addressing water scarcity and other water problems in Malaysia. WWP also work with government and water service providers in reducing high rates of non-revenue water, upgrading water treatment plants, increasing awareness, public education and other important water related issues.",

      "recipientDetail": "<b>History</b>\nThe history of our work began in 1999. Through the outreach of New Covenant Community Church, Rev. Elisha Satvinder and his wife Petrina, the founders, quickly discovered many underprivileged families in the Sentul area.\n\nConcerned over the welfare of the poor in the area, the church began to reach out to the community through basic home improvement services, grocery distribution, arrangement of free medical check-ups, raising support for school supplies, job placements and counselling. They quickly realised that with the limited resources and man-power at their disposal, this work, while helpful, would not have the lasting impact they so wanted to see.\n\nBelieving that quality education was the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, the efforts of the programme began to consolidate and focus solely on education. What began as simple tuition classes soon attracted a daily attendance of over 50 students. However, children who were already behind continued to struggle.\n\nAfter some training, efforts where renewed with a focus on toddlers and preschool aged children.\n\nThe work officially came under the name of Harvest Centre in 2003 and the first Montessori Preschool for the underprivileged opened its doors to 30 students in January, 2004. As the education programmes began to grow, the primary and secondary education programmes were added on.\n\nIn 2010, all Harvest Centre education projects came under the name of Dignity for Children Foundation.\n\nDignity aims to is to empower underprivileged children to break the cycle of poverty through quality education, thus positively transforming their lives and the lives of the community around them.\n\n<b>Our services</b>\nDignity for Children Foundation operates three main education programmes:\n1. Early Childhood Education Programme (ECEP)\n2. Primary Education Programme (PEP)\n3. Secondary Education Programme (SEP)",

The dependencies of urban dwellers on other people to produce food is one huge contributing factor to the problems above. There is enough research to prove that urban farming is a great and simple solution all of us can embark on.\n\nThe ‘Pop’ and team are committed to help turn every home into a food production machine as well. Through the use of appropriate technology and innovation, we can now build modular farm units that can suit different types of homes. Some of our designs are completely indoors.\n\nIn this quest, we are implementing various urban farming approaches to suit different home conditions, from soil based gardens to hydroponics. Our favourite method is Aquaponics!\n\nOur products and services also cater to different levels, from educational tools for kids to real serious setups that could feed your family. Whichever level you are, we have a solution for you! We’re here to make urban farming convenient, easy, and fun for everyone, one step at a time.\n\nWe envision a world where people think of food in so much abundance, because every single person is producing food more then what they consume. Fresh, healthy and plenty!\n\nLet’s put an end to our food problems, one house at a time.\n\n<b>Aquaponics</b>\nFish feed plants, plants clean water for fish.\n\nAquaponics is a more natural and efficient form of home farming. It’s a symbiotic system of fish and plants, where through the simple act of feeding fish, you can quickly grow a variety of plants for cooking. The water in the system cycles around; plants love the nutrient rich fish water, and fish love the water being cleaned for them. This cycle is the age-old way nature has developed to sustain itself.\n\n<b>Eat natural</b>\nLearn about what you can grow in different conditions, and how easy it is to grow and produce delicious meals.\n\nPoptani sells different sized Aquaponics kits which allow you to grow organic herbs, fruit and vegetables. These allow for varying sized fish for decoration or for food.",

      "recipientDetail": "Tropical Rainforest Conservation & Research Centre (TRCRC), a non-governmental organization (NGO), is a sister company of Landskap Malaysia.\n\nLandskap Malaysia, established in 2009 and chaired by YAbhg. Tun Jeanne, focuses on enhancing public awareness and cultivating a Malaysian society that values nature and its importance in our world, focusing on tropical rainforest plants.\n\nThe existence of TRCRC is of a broader scale vision, which is the conservation and preservation of tropical rainforest plant species, to further help enhance the efforts of other related NGO’s and in cultivating and maintaining a stable ecosystem.\n\n<b>Objectives</b>\nWith the ever-increasing rate of deforestation throughout South-East Asia, the loss of plant species remains a major conservation concern. Efforts throughout the world have been carried out to safeguard plant species by preserving those that can be stored in refrigerated volts.\n\nThe conservation and preservation of tropical rainforest species remains a challenging task. A large percentage of tropical seeds are generally recalcitrant and remain difficult to store for long periods. In order to increase efforts to avoid the loss of tropical plant species and to minimize the effects of deforestation as well as natural and man-made disasters, Tropical Rainforest Conservation Research Centre (TRCRC) aim to establish multiple ex-situ Tropical Rainforest Living Collection Centers (TRLCC) and plant nurseries throughout Malaysia, where we will collect, germinate, propagate, and eventually reintroduce rare and endangered plant species back into its native habitats.\n\nHowever, not all tropical plants are recalcitrant. Species which can be stored will be stored in a future Tropical Rainforest Seed Bank that is aimed to be established in Sabah.\n\nThe establishment of TRLCC will complement relevant government agencies, NGOs and organizations involved in the preservation and conservation of tropical rainforests in Malaysia for a better, stable ecosystem.",

      "recipientDetail": "<b>About Us</b>\nIn October 2012, the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) took the initiative to set up the IDEAS Autism Centre (IAC) in Rawang, Selangor, as part of our effort to provide care for those in need, and at the same time to research and develop a sustainable social enterprise model that can be replicated to help underprivileged children. The IAC is registered with the Department for Social Welfare (reg no: B/TI 151/2012)\n\nGood quality care should be accessible for everyone. Early intervention care (3-9 years) is the most critical stage for children with autism and it is necessary for these children to assimilate into mainstream primary schools. Children with autism have significant strengths and can use these to develop skills that enable them to participate in society We work in partnership with EAP to achieve outstanding personalised services.\n\n<b>What We Do</b>\nThe centre operates from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm. During this time, children attending the IAC receive daily care services, speech therapy, occupational therapy, as well as educational support to prepare them for mainstream school. The IAC also provides meals for the children, based on their healthy eating guideline.\n\nThe teaching method at IAC is inspired by the principles of home-based intensive behavioural treatment programme and applied behavioural analysis (ABA).\n\nIAC’s curriculum is guided by the National Special Education curriculum which is tailored to the specific needs of the individual child. Every child is assessed prior to entry and a tailored individual educational plan (IEP) is then developed. This is then updated based on their progress and assessment at the end of every six months.\n\nThe main learning areas in the curriculum are attending skills, imitation skills, receptive language skills, expressive language skills, pre-academic skills, self-help skills, art education, music and movement, physical exercise, social skills and school readiness.",

Yayasan Sejahtera is dedicated to addressing extreme poverty in line with two National Key Result Areas: raising living standards of low-income households, and improving basic rural infrastructure.\n\nOur work with the hardcore poor invests in both short term needs and long term outcomes. While Malaysia is a success story in the area of poverty reduction, the poor still rely on handouts which do not contribute towards long term impact or independent existence. Yayasan Sejahtera was created to demonstrate that there is a more sustainable approach to providing social welfare to communities.\n\nSejahtera aims to create the real sustainable impact to the entire targeted communities by addressing different groups – Adults, Youth and Children – for a more comprehensive assistance to those needing it the most.",

Founded in 1993, ASLI is the definitive voice of strategy and leadership in the country, having through the years, provided strategic and trusted insights to governments, businesses and diplomatic communities.\n\nASLI is owned and governed by the not-for-profit Jeffrey Cheah Foundation, which is Malaysia’s largest education-focused social enterprise. This underscores the Foundation’s remit in providing “thought leadership” as a key component in its mission of nation-building and creating a prosperous and progressive Malaysia. This enhances ASLI’s independence, allowing us to maintain a nuanced impartiality and intellectual integrity. \n\nWe are a not-for-profit organisation, freeing us from tyranny of the bottom line while ensuring our sustainability. One avenue through which we carry out our mission is to serve as a connector linking key stakeholders in the nation. This role is particularly relevant given the socio-economic challenges facing our country. And there is a crucial need for ASLI as the credible platform where all voices can be heard and robust debate can be conducted in a civil manner.\n\nOur goal is to create thought-provoking and intellectual dialogues among government, businesses and civil society in Malaysia in an effort to influence and bring change in public policies for the betterment of society. In the wider Asia Pacific region, we capitalise on our influential network to harness best practices and connect business opportunities. By convening industry thought leaders to exchange views, develop policy options and offer key recommendations, we provide strategic analysis and advice on critical issues impacting the nation and beyond. By leveraging the strong network, we connect strategic partners across APAC on highest-value business investment and trade opportunities to foster bilateral relations and economic growth."

Atas jasa Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato’ Haji Harun Idris dan isteri Y.Bhg Datin Salmah Suleiman, Kerajaan Negeri Selangor telah mengurniakan sebidang tanah di Mukim Hulu Kelang (HS.231) seluas 4.8 ekar mengikut dokumen kelulusan bilangan PHT.G.2/139/75. Untuk menentukan projek ini dapat dilaksanakan dengan jayanya Y.Bhg Allahyarham Dato’ Haji Harun Idris telah dilantik sebagai Pengerusi Pertubuhan ini.\n\nHasil dari usaha gigih mereka inilah, beberapa program telah dijalankan seperti Majlis Jamuan Makan Malam, Tayangan Perdana serta rayuan kepada ahli-ahli, Pertubuhan ini telah berjaya mendirikan bangunan Rumah bakti dengan kos sebanyak RM158,107.81. DYMM Almarhum Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Alhaj ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Sultan Selangor telah perkenan untuk menjadi Penaung RBHK. Pada peringkat awal, pengambilan anak-anak yatim telah mula dibuat pada tahun 1976 iaitu seramai 26 orang yang terdiri daripada 13 lelaki dan 13 perempuan yang berumur antara 6 hingga 12 tahun. RBHK telah dirasmikan oleh DYMM Sultan Selangor pada 5 Mac 1977. Dari setahun ke setahun jumlah anak-anak yatim telah bertambah dan sehingga kini pada tahun 2010, Rumah Bakti dihuni oleh seramai 81 orang yang berumur daripada 7 hingga 17 tahun.\n\nPada 2 Mac 1982 dua buah blok asrama dua tingkat yang baru telah siap dibina. Kedua blok asrama tersebut bernilai RM600,000.00 dan disumbangkan oleh Kerajaan Negeri Selangor dan hasil derma orang ramai. Sebuah surau juga telah dibina pada tahun 1984. Pada tahun 2009 sebuah surau baru telah dibina bagi menggantikan surau lama. Surau baru ini telah disumbangkan oleh Y. Bhg Datin Salmah Sulaiman, isteri Allahyarham Dato’ Haji Harun Idris. RBHK telah mendapat perpustakaan baru pada tahun 1989. Perpustakaan ini menjadi Pusat Sumber pada tahun 1997. Oleh kerana RBHK telah mendapat surau baru, maka surau lama yang dibina pada 1984 itu diubah suai menjadi Pusat Sumber yang baru. Pusat Sumber ini dibahagikan kepada dua bahagian iaitu, perpustakaan dan bilik multimedia.",

In promoting human dignity and integrity, the SSVP works to redress situations which adversely affect peoples’ lives and their basic rights. The SSVP was founded in 1833 by Frederic Ozanam who was then a student of Sorbonne University in Paris.\n\nSSVP is established across the five continents in 133 countries, with a membership of 900,000. The SSVP aims to help men, women and families to break their cycle of poverty and disadvantage. It is not a benevolent society but works on a person to person basis.\n\nThe SSVP in Malaysia began in 1934 with the first Conference (as our branches are called) formed in the Church of the Assumption, Penang. To-date we have 62 conferences with a membership of 900.\n\nThe primary works of the Conferences in Malaysia is to give out monthly subsidies in the form of food rations, school expenses, bus fares and pay for schooling needs at the beginning of the school term like uniforms, shoes, exercise books and other yearly fee . Another important role is home visits to the needy to access their needs and also counsel them.\n\nSometimes in the mid 80’s the SSVP embarked on a mission of ‘teaching them to fish instead of providing them the fish’. The aim was to bring them out of the poverty cycle. It was then decided to set up Homes and bring children from poverty areas and broken families and provide them a conducive learning and living environment. This gave birth to the creation of the first Home ‘RUMAH OZANAM’(named after our founder Frederic Ozanam). Today SSVP in Selangor have 12 other homes/centers catering to various needs of the less fortunate among us.",

      "recipientDetail": "AFS Intercultural Programs (formerly the American Field Service) is a worldwide, nonprofit organization that has been leading student exchange for more than 55 years. AFS was founded by volunteer ambulance drivers who survived World War I and II. They believed—as AFS believes today—that the way to build a more just and peaceful world begins when people from different countries and cultures meet, learn t o g e t h e r, and better understand one another. The drivers sought to promote international understanding and peace through student exchanges. In 1947, AFS exchanged 52 young people from 11 countries formerly at war.\n\nToday, AFS exchanges more than 11,000 students each year among a partnership of more than 50 AFS Partner Countries. There are more than 300,000 individuals who have studied abroad with AFS. AFS Returnees live in more than 100 countries around the world. AFS is one of the largest volunteer- b a s e d organizations of its kind in the world with 100,000 volunteers worldwide and more than 8,000 in the U.S.\n\n<b>About Yayasan Antarabudaya Malaysia</b>\nEach year, AFS Antarabudaya Malaysia sends more than 200 exchange students abroad for year, semester and short term programs (including programs that focus on language study and community service), and welcomes more than 100 exchange students from other countries to Malaysia.\n\nWhile in Malaysia, students study in local high schools and live with host families to learn what it is like to live as a member of a family and community within our country.\n\nAFS impact can be seen through the success of the former AFS participants. Many have achieved careers as diplomats, educators, business executives and involved members of their communities. AFS offers the world a greater hope for a lasting peace when an important segment of the leadership of the world shares the powerful bond of an AFS experience.",

      "recipientDetail": "United Learning Centre (ULC) is a safe haven for Myanmar refugee children to live, love, learn and play, enabling them to rise above their circumstances and reach their potential.\n\nULC provides food and a caring home for 80 to 100 children ranging from 4 to 16 years old. These children do not otherwise have access to education in Malaysia due to their refugee status. We strive to provide them not only with life’s basic necessities, but more importantly, empowerment through education.\n\n<b>Our Story</b>\nPastor Jonathan, a refugee from Myanmar saw the need to set up a learning centre for the Myanmar refugee children who were running in the street and were great risk. He partnered with Mink Ong and together they agreed to raise funds for the centre.\n\nIt was also agreed that the language used in the centre should be the Myanmar language instead of dialect and that the centre would accept children from all dialect groups regardless of race, language or religion, uniting as one. Naming the centre United Learning Centre will be a constant reminder of the aim to teach the children about unity.\n\nIn 2011, ULC rented an apartment in Jalan Medan Imbi. Sadly, funds were running out and the school was at risk of eviction. To their surprise, they were offered a rundown bungalow for a token sum of RM 1,000 a month. Both Pastor Jonathan and Mink moved in and quickly made this the new home for ULC.\n\nIn 2016, Pastor Jonathan was offered resettlement in Austin, U.S., Mink Ong remained as the fundraiser and Julian, another Myanmar refugee was hired to run the centre. In order to achieve transparency in the ULC management, a governance committee was established.\n\n<b>Donation</b>\nDonate is much appreciated which can be done <a href=\"http://www.unitedlearningcentre.com.my/donate\">here</a>.",

      "recipientDetail": "This project arises from the needs that have evolved from our traditional works of mercy with the poor in the outlying areas of PJ and KL and in particular the former squatter settlements.\n\n<b>Our services</b>\nOur works, observation and studies have clearly shown that in order to enable and empower the poor living in such areas, and more specifically the single mothers, obtaining full time employment has been hampered by the need for them to look after the younger children. This only allows them to seek part time housekeeping work where their monthly income often does not exceed 300 RM per month. This problem is further compounded if they do have to also support aged parents or if one of the spouses is disabled through accidents etc and bedridden.\n\nA fundamental requirement in our efforts to raise their self esteem was the need to provide opportunities for them to seek gainful full time employment. At the same time, there is also a need to raise and enhance their skills to increase their earning potential.\n\nThe children on the other hand often require support (moral, financial and tutorial support) in education as well as the need for them acquire healthy habits of living, eat balanced diets regularly and obtain proper health care.\n\nProviding opportunities to the Youth to help realise and develop their potential will be a very important aspect of the centre. Very often the youth and older children are neglected and tend to be dragged into the social vices that are linked with the general population in such areas. They lack avenues to develop their potential and this centre should help build their self-esteem and confidence so that the youths will be engaged in productive activities.\n\n<b>Things we do:</b>\n1) Provide administrative service to numerous residents in helping resolve issue like obtaining proper birth certificates for their children, proper housing document, welfare aid application etc.\n\n2) Provide counselling services, training courses etc.\n\n3) Look at food coupons and other self sustenance projects especially during economic downturns.\n\n4) Seeking and providing better working conditions and income potential to the door. Child-care to young children enabling the parents (mainly single parents and mothers) to seek full time employment opportunities free from worries of their children’s care and welfare.\n\n5) Attending to educational requirements of the children (school) as well as providing a conducive environment for the children to study when not in school.\n\n6) Provide medical care and balanced -nutrition to the children under our care.\n\n7) Assist single mothers in their plights and enabling them to rebuild a life of dignity and self respect of themselves and their children.Provide the mothers a forum to discuss their problems and to empower one another. To organize self help programs at the centre for the parents.\n\n8) Working with delinquent youths and resourcing opportunities to develop their skills and talents; career guidance and counselling services to the youths and students; provide tertiary educational opportunity or trade/ skill programs for school leavers wishing to develop a career in their respective are of interest.\n\n9) Organise medical clinics.\n\n10) Networking with other similar minded group, NGO’s, government bodies, corporate sector to be able to provide solutions to clients who visit out centre.",

      "recipientDetail": "The centre began in 1985 when a few Christians namely, Dato Dr Tan Kee Kwong, Bishop Rt. Rev. Hwa Yung, Mr. Chris Fung and Rev. Davadass, burdened with the social needs were moved to pool their resources  and ideas to begin a social ministry in the Sentul – Ipoh Road area. Thus, PBS was registered with the Registrar of Societies on 7th February 1987. PBS began with the help of volunteers to organise tuition classes, blood donation drives, legal and medical aid and personal counselling. Currently PBS is established to provide regular services with an office of full time staff and volunteers.\n\n<b>Our activities</b>\nThe programs include tuition classes, motivational seminars for examination students, educational excursions, camps and outings during the school holidays, regular sporting activities, health camps on drug abuse, dengue SARs  and the like.\n\n<b>Community Activities</b>\nFor women especially single, needy mothers from all walks of life, we provide basic foodstuff on a bi-monthly basis, arrange for work for them to be independent, organize counselling and Mother Camp sessions. For underprivileged families we give basic food provisions, organize health camps and blood donation drives, help families to secure housing from DBKL and have a weekly soup kitchen to distribute free food to the poor and homeless. As such, we have meetings with local leaders/ authorities, school heads and have regular dialogue with the welfare organization.\n\nOver the last 22 years, PBS has seen many changes due to the dedication and support of the donors, staff, volunteers and board members and is thereby continuing to touch lives in the Sentul-Jalan Chow Kit-Jalan Ipoh-Jinjang-Selayang area.\n\n<b>Our vision</b>\nAs much as we would like to expand our activities to provide better aid to the community, we are hampered by a lack of various resources. Just as the  activities of  PBS has filled a void for the past 22 years, it is still relevant today as it was when we first started.\n\nWe have many families receiving provisions from us. Unfortunately we had to turn away some as our stock supply was running low. It is the desire of the Board that  more people will come forward to share whatever talent they have – it can be time,expertise, money, signing up as members, volunteers to teach/help children with their homework, etc.",

      "recipientDetail": "<b>History</b>\nA small group of Korean expatriates and Malaysians living in Kuala Lumpur (Ampang, Selangor) recognised the predicament faced by the refugees and started an initiative to help them. The main effort is to provide basic education for children and was started in premises provided by a Korean language studio in Ampang. Initially an informal class had been started to teach simple English to Afghan children. A small group of 7 children started class in October 2007. Teachers served on a voluntary basis. Some Korean expatriates, Malaysian individuals, Uzbekistan nationals and a German residing in Ampang, Selangor offered their services to teach. Later more social workers joined in to provide their services and help. With humble beginnings the Hilla Community Centre in AMPANG, SELANGOR (Hilla) was born. The name ‘Hilla’ comes from the Pashto language of the Afghan people that mean ‘hope’. It is indeed our heart’s desire to give hope to the Afghans and other refugee communities. We try to give them a start through education because we firmly believe that ‘education is the beacon of hope’ that can transform individuals and communities to be successful and better people.\n\nThrough Hilla, we reach out to the people in need of help .The classes began to grow bigger as more Afghan parents came to Hilla to request that their children be admitted for classes. As more people came in, space became a constraint and larger premises were needed. Eventually, in January 2008 the centre moved to a double storey corner link house in Ampang. Two classes were formed with 30 plus students. Initially, only students below 15 years old were admitted. However, later more demand came from older people. This includes older siblings and some parents who also want to learn English. By 2010 the centre has 5 classes with a total of 19 volunteer teachers. The total enrolment of students attending day classes is 65.\n\nThe students age between seven and 19 years old. Day classes are conducted from Mondays to Saturdays, 9am to 1pm. Parents are encouraged to attend separate night classes as the approach to teach adults is different. Initially the centre focused on Afghan refugees. However people from other refugee communities, e.g. Myanmar refugees, also approached the centre to admit their children.  Today the centre strives to reach out to all refugee communities in need of assistance regardless of their nationality, religion or creed.\n\n<b>Our services</b>\nThe centre started with teaching English. Learning the language was an urgent matter for the refugees as most of them spoke only their own mother tongue. They need the English language to communicate with other people as well as prepare for their future relocation to a foreign land. As more volunteer teachers came forward to provide their services, the centre progressively was able to offer education for more subjects. Today the classes conducted include Bahasa Malaysia, Mathematics, Science, Arts and Craft, Piano, Vocal and Computers. Educational trips are organized to enhance the students learning experience. The centre also has an adjacent piece of land within its compound. Physical education classes are conducted here. It also serves as both a playground and activities centre for the students. In 2009, the Malaysian Ministry of Education announced that refugees are allowed to sit for the local government examinations. Hilla need to look forward to employ proper tutors to assist the students in their studies  for the exams.\n\nThe centre has also embarked on the initiative to provide job training and counseling for adult refugees. A flat near the Hilla Community Centre had been rented for the purpose. Adults and older students are taught working skills. The subjects include computer skills and hairdressing. Where possible, we also assist to find work for the adults. This includes jobs like tailoring, baking, cleaning, furniture removal and sales assistants.\n\n<B>Our vision</b>\nOur vision and aim is to help the refugee communities in Ampang, Selangor through education and job training. We aim to provide them with basic education and some job skills to improve their situation and self-esteem.\n\nThe Hilla Community Centre was started with charitable contributions from kind hearted individuals. The money collected is used to pay for the costs incurred in running our school and training centre. This includes the rental of the school premises, books, stationery, utilities, maintenance, transportation costs and teachers’ allowance. We take the students for educational outings and sports competition with other refugee schools. For this we incur transportation, admission ticket and other incidental costs. The following table lists our estimated monthly expenses.\n\n<b>Donation</b>\nBANK ACCOUNT name: Tneh Yen Fung\nCIMB Bank: 1284-0002116-52-2\n\nFor tax free donations:\nPlease make a cheque payable to Yayasan Sunbeams Homes and make a note at the back “for Hilla Community Centre”",

It is run by Persatuan Orang Kurang Upaya Bangsa Ria KL & Sel (POKU Bangsa Ria). Located at 40, Jalan 12/14, 46200 Petaling Jaya, the centre is open on weekdays from as early as 7.30 a.m. and closes when the last child leaves by 6 p.m. \n\n<b>Our children</b>\nMost of Bangsa Ria children are aged from 6 years to 43 years and fall below the entry level upon which they can be accepted in many other centres. For instance, only one speaks with any proficiency. Two others can be understood (they are improving every day!). The rest are unable to speak, dress them selves, go to the toilet on their own, eat without help and so on. They are almost entirely dependent on others to take care of their needs. Even the three mentioned above who can communicate needs to be closely supervised.\n\nDespite their disabilities, our children smile, laugh and share happily. They love coming to the centre. It is a place of love, caring, laughter and warmth. It is a sanctuary. It is a home where they feel comfortable and safe. And yes, those who can speak, do squabble, especially over who should wipe the tables after lunch!",

      "recipientDetail": "Selangor Family Aid Association is a non profit organisation with a primary aim of providing a home for the aged, handicapped, mentally retarded Down syndrome and the orphanage.\n\n<b>Our history</b>\nThe Selangor Family Aid Association is a voluntary multi racial welfare organisation. It was established on the 8th of July 1988 by Mr Pusparajah Gunaratnam(G.P. Raj ), with the primary aim to help the needy such as the Old Folks, The Mentally Retarded , The Handicapped, The Down Syndrome and The Orphanage children etc. .In the past, the Association has also helped with provisions for the Poor and The Orang Asli (natives), and provided school meals for less privileged children. Due to the growing demands with the in house residents and lack of funding it has become necessary to just focus on the residents at hand.\n\nOriginally, the residents were accommodated in rented houses comprising a total of 12 residents. As the numbers grew, it was getting increasingly difficult to meet the needs of the residents. Hence, our founder member Mr G. P. Raj decided to build a better and a more permanent home for this unfortunate and under privileged society.\n\nCurrently, The Association has 87 residents and are able to accommodate up to 150. We also have about 15 members of staff, providing the necessary help and medical attention in the management of the home.\n\nTo maintain the home successfully, the Association is in constant need of funds, approximately Rm47,000 per month. At this level of funding, it is often a huge challenge. However, the management is always looking forward for ways in pushing the boundaries further in its struggle to have a smooth operation of the home.\n\n<b>Our objectives</b>\n1) To provide care and attention for the needy such as The Old Folks, The Mentally Retarded, The Orphanage, The Down Syndrome etc. Specialist nursing care is often required. However, it is given to each individual but the level of care is dependent on the number of specialised staff that can be employed successfully.\n\n2) To provide shelter for the abused: especially child abuse and destitute single mothers with low or no income. A lot of domestic violence are on the increase and women and children are often left homeless and it is also the prerogative of the Association to handle each case on its merit.\n\n3) To establish and manage a haemodialysis centre. It is a centre for the dialysis patients, especially with diabetic cases. Unfortunately, a lot of people die needlessly due to the lack of these facilities and sheer costs to the individual. Hence, it is the aim of the Association to provide financial aid for the poor who are unable to meet these dialysis costs.\n\n4) To establish and manage a clinic and medical service centre for the residents of the home and the under privileged. This will be not only an invaluable aid to the residents but properly harnessed it could generate an income for the future for the home.\n\n<b>Our activities</b>\nThe residents are always encouraged to participate in recommended daily  activities in order to keep their minds and bodies in healthy condition. These are considered to be therapeutic and a good pastime.\n\nAlthough most of the residents are not capable to carry out any responsible activities of their own, the staff do however conduct special occupational therapy programmes such as handy crafts and painting. At times, the residents are given outing entertainments usually by voluntary groups. These may include dinners, social functions and other sight seeing activities.\n\n<b>Our needs</b>\nWe appeal to your sympathetic and humanitarian sentiments in helping us to provide the basic amenities of life to these underprivileged human beings who are in want of attention and proper care.\n\nPlease send cheques addressed to “Selangor Family Aid Association\" and send to:\nLot 455, Jalan Besar, Kg Kalong Tengah, 44300 Ulu Yam Bharu, Ulu Selangor, Selangor Darul Ehsan\n\nor\n\nDirect Payments can be made to the bank:-\nBANK: Public Bank\nBANK BRANCH : Batang Kali\nA/C No:3121036133",
