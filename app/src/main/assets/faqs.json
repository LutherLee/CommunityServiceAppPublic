Triber at its core is a mobile app volunteering directory for Malaysia with the ability to suggest the relevant service recipients based on usersâ€™ preferences and app usage behaviour.\n<br><br>\nTriber was created to enhance individuals' ability for better selection of service recipients by providing a central database of others' feedback on various service recipients. It exposes various types of service recipients, volunteering opportunities and crowdfunding platform availability in Malaysia.",

    "faqAnswer": "This project is continuously maintained with the expectation to enable volunteering and donation easier and more accessible. Some features or improvements that are planned to be included in the near future are as follows:\n<br><br>\n<b>Hosting of Volunteering Events</b><br>\nTaking a step further to facilitate volunteering, the idea is to allow the user a way to host (create) their volunteering event recruitment by which like-minded people can sign up themselves  for the recruitment they wish to join towards a common objective. With this, it is not necessary for individuals looking for volunteering activities to contact the recipient to ask for details as sufficient information will be listed out when hosting such an event. \n<br><br>\nThe creator of the recruitment can specify the number of volunteers they would like to accept within a specific timeline. This way they can recruit the required volunteers easily and reduce the issue of overflooding enquiries. Further discussion of job responsibilities may be discussed through private messaging, either in-app or through an external app.\n<br><br>\n<b>In-App Donation</b><br>\nUser can expect support for in-app donation to their preferred recipient in the future using credit/debit card. The goal is to provide little to no processing fee for each transaction.\n<br><br>\n<b>Support for Multiple Address</b><br>\nSome recipient may have more than one address due to having multiple branches. Currently, each address would be considered as a separate recipient, for example <i>\"Recipient A (KL)\"</i> and <i>\"Recipient A (Selangor)\"</i>. User has to access (view) each of them separately.\n<br><br>\nWith support for multiple addresses, a user should be able to view all the address of a recipient in different states from the same details page and get direction to the selected address.\n<br><br>\n<b>Support for Filtering Recipient From all Malaysia State</b><br>\nUser is only allowed to filter 3 states (Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya) currently. It is understood that this is far from the complete 13 states as data collection of recipient information is a tedious process and the information may change anytime.<br>\nUser would be able to access a larger collection of recipient information with better efficiency to search for a suitable recipient when all Malaysia state are included.\n<br><br>\n<b>Support For Multiple Social Media of the Same Platform</b><br>\nSome recipient may have more than one account for a particular social media, for example, multiple accounts for Instagram. User should be able to view all known social media of the recipient in the future.\n<br><br>\n<b>Improve Distance Calculation Between User and Recipient</b><br>\nRight now in the <i>Map</i> tab, for the feature \"Sort Recipient By Distance\", distance are calculated based on the geocoordinate with no regards for the driving route (by air, land or sea) as well as the traffic involved. With improved distance calculation, user can better gauge and plan their journey.\n<br><br>\n<b>Geofencing</b><br>\nWith geofencing, user can automatically be alerted when they are nearby a service recipient.",
