## What is Triber?
It all started as a project to make finding where to volunteer easier on the mobile platform with the option to navigate to the address efficiently. Triber at its core is a mobile app volunteering directory for Malaysia with the ability to suggest the relevant service recipients based on usersâ€™ preferences and app usage behaviour.

Triber was created to enhance individuals' ability for better selection of service recipients by providing a central database of others' feedback on various service recipients. It exposes various types of service recipients, volunteering opportunities and crowdfunding platform availability in Malaysia.

__Aim__<br>
To create awareness of civic responsibility in the role that can be played by individuals towards the contributions in supporting their community. The volunteering activities may take place in public institutions such as hospital, non-profit organizations, welfare homes and environmental organizations.

__Objectives__<br>
1) To assist individuals in finding suitable service recipients (NGOs / NPOs) in Malaysia to provide their volunteering service and be exposed to a wide variety of opportunities.
2) To build recognition for the help rendered to the needy and contribution made for the development of society.
3) To understand the social issues and responsibilities to gain a sense of belonging to the society.
